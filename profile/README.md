## **About**

**My Dev Playground** is an organization created to centralize my study projects and code experiments in **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Python**, **PHP**, and **Java**.

I've been in contact with software development for about **3 years**, starting with **Java** and gradually discovering other technologies along the way.

The goal is to maintain an organized history of my evolution as a developer, including:

- Improving programming logic
- Studying data structures
- Practicing object-oriented programming
- Experiments and proof of concepts
- Small systems and complete applications

Some repositories document my way of thinking, how I solve problems, and how my logic develops over time. Others represent more basic exercises, revisiting and reinforcing concepts from foundational to more advanced levels.

In summary: this organization contains code ranging from **beginner to advanced**, serving as a form of documentation of my skills and journey as a developer.
